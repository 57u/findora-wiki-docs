### Transfer Transaction[​](https://wiki.findora.org/docs/evm\_guides/use\_wallet/findora\_wallet/transfer#transfer-transaction) <a href="#transfer-transaction" id="transfer-transaction"></a>

To send a transaction follow the steps below:

1. Go to the `Send` page, and fill out all input fields

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (79).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* `From` - the wallet address you will send tokens from
* `To` - the wallet address you will send tokens to
* `Asset Type` - pull-down menu showing all available asset types (i.e. tokens) you can send\
  Note: If you have created (or imported in) custom asset types into your wallet, then you will be able to select these custom assets. Else, you will only see a single option for `fra` tokens
* `Amount` - amount to send to recipient
* `Show or Hide Amounts on Ledger?` - By selecting `Hide Amounts`, the transfer becomes a confidential transfer and the amount will be masked on the transaction log of the public block explorer
* `Show or Hide Asset Type on Ledger?` - By selecting `Hide Asset Type`, the transfer becomes a confidential transfer and the asset type will be masked on the transaction log of the public block explorer

2\. Click `Next` and a confirmation screen will appear

Note: This transaction log was for a confidential transaction with `Hide Amounts` and `Hide Asset Type`enabled. Thus, the amounts and asset type is masked with \*\*\* on the public log shown on the block explorer

### Transparent Transfer[​](https://wiki.findora.org/docs/evm\_guides/use\_wallet/findora\_wallet/transfer#transparent-transfer) <a href="#transparent-transfer" id="transparent-transfer"></a>

Step 1: Sign in into your Findora wallet then click on the wallet name you want to make a transfer from.

Step 2: Make sure you have enough balance for your transfer, then click on "Send".

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (82).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Step 3: In the next step, you should see a few input fields. - The "From" input field designates the wallet you're transferring from. - The "To" input field is where you enter the recipient's wallet address. - "Asset Type" refers to the asset that is being transferred - "Privacy Options" to choose whether to hide the asset type and amount.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (49) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Step 4: In the "To" input field, copy and paste the recipient's address and please make sure that you have this correct

> Tip: If you are moving assets among different wallets saved on your Findora wallet application, you can click on the "Wallet Address" drop down on the side, and it will be automatically filled with the corresponding wallet address

Step 5: Enter the amount you want to transfer

Step 6: Now we get to the more important part. To effectively do a transparent transfer, click on the "Show Amounts" to keep the amount transparent, and select "Show Asset Type" radio button to publicly show which asset you're transferring

Step 8: Review the transaction details and click on `Submit`

Step 9: Click on "View Transaction" to get a detailed view of the status of the transaction

That is how a transparent transfer is done. You can verify the transaction on the block explorer using the transaction hash generated.
