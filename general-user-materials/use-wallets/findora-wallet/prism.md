# Prism

Prism allows you to transfer FRA between the EVM and UTXO chains on Findora. By using Prism, users can move their FRA from their MetaMask wallet (EVM) to their native wallet (UTXO) for staking purposes.

### Step #1

Export the private key from MetaMask and store it in a secure location.&#x20;

> Note:
>
> The private key gives any holder full access to your assets stored in your account. Do not share this with any untrusted individual, dApp, or service.

### Step #2

Go to the **Prism** section on the [Findora Wallet](https://wallet.findora.org/) and choose a transfer direction by clicking the arrow icon. In this guide, we show how to transfer from an EVM-compatible Wallet such as MetaMask to the Native Wallet. However, you can reverse the direction according to your needs by clicking the allow, as shown below.

> Prism currently supports the private key extracted from MetaMask. If you meet any problem when importing private key from other EVM-compatible wallet, please use MetaMask instead.

### Step #4

Input the amount and the destination wallet address, and click `Next`. You may also click the `Address` button to select an account already created in your Findora Wallet.
