# The Reward Raffles

There are three raffles in the Game Chain Challenges event on Galxe:&#x20;

**1.) The USDT Standard Raffle**: The 250 USDT raffle requires two OATs, Bard & Guardian. To enter the raffle, complete the 1st campaign (Celebrate) and 2nd campaign (Play), obtain each OAT, and proceed to the Standard Raffle.

{% hint style="info" %}
Because this raffle happens on Galxe, you must join the Standard Raffle [campaign](https://galxe.com/Findora/campaign/GC2w6UjusW), which verifies you have both OATs to be eligible.
{% endhint %}

**2.) Bonus | The Game Winners Raffle**: Players who win a game of Enders Gate will automatically be eligible for an additional prize pool with $500 worth of FRA. Ten lucky, random winners will each receive a reward of $50 in FRA. The coins will be based on the 24-hour average at the closing of this campaign series on September 4.

{% hint style="info" %}
By simply winning the Champion’s OAT, you will automatically be entered into this raffle. Stay tuned to Findora social media channels after the completion of the campaign for the raffle drawing.\

{% endhint %}

**3.) Bonus | The Referral Raffle:** The $100 FRA referral raffle requires you to refer a friend to the first campaign (Celebrate) and second campaign (Play). The [Referral Campaign](https://galxe.com/Findora/campaign/GC4SYUjKLY) checks if your referral completed the steps of those two campaigns before you become eligible for this raffle. Four random lucky winners will receive $25 in FRA, Findora’s native coin, calculated by the 24-hour average price at the close of the Game Chain Challenges event.
