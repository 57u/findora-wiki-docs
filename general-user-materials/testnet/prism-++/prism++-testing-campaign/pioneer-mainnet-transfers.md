<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (13).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Youâ€™ll keep leveling up as you complete more tasks and Prism++ Transfer Loops. To complete a Prism++ Transfer Loop, youâ€™ll transfer tokens from your EVM wallet to UTXO Wallet 1 using Prism++. Then youâ€™ll confidentially transfer those tokens to UTXO Wallet 2 before transferring them back to the original EVM wallet using Prism++.

Your task will be to transfer any amount of USDT tokens to complete a Prism++ Loop on Mainnet as shown in the above chart.&#x20;

You will need a small amount of FRA to pay gas and a small amount of USDT to transfer on mainnet. But donâ€™t worry! We will airdrop every address with the [Peasant badge the FRA and USDT](peasant-prism++-campaign-signup.md) theyâ€™ll need to become a full-fledged Prism Pioneer.\
