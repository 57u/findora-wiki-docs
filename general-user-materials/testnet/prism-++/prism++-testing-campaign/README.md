## Campaign Overview&#x20;

To test Prism++, you‚Äôll embark on a journey from Prism Peasant to a Prism Pioneer. Your rank will increase with each task you complete.&#x20;

The process is simple and easy:&#x20;

1. [Setup the Findora Testnet Wallet](testnet-wallet-setup-funding.md)
2. [Sign up for the Campaign](peasant-prism++-campaign-signup.md) on Project Galxe&#x20;
3. Perform Prism++ Transfers using FRC20 Tokens on Anvil Testnet
4. üèÖ Level Up!
5. Repeat Step-3 for FRC721 and FRC1155
6. Repeat Step-3 for USDT on Mainnet (Available April 10th)
7. üèÖ Become a Prism++ Pioneer

You‚Äôll keep leveling up as you complete more tasks and Prism++ Transfer Loops.&#x20;

To complete a Prism++ Transfer Loop you will:

* Transfer tokens from an EVM wallet to a UTXO Wallet using Prism++
* Confidentially transfer those tokens between two UTXO&#x20;
* Transfer them back to the original EVM wallet using Prism++Then you‚Äôll wallets before \

## Campaign Tasks and Ranks

To start, download the Findora testnet wallet and generate two wallet addresses on UTXO (fra‚Ä¶).

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you have a Findora wallet already, be sure to export your private keys before downloading the testnet wallet. This is best practice and allows you to recover your wallet if anything happens.
{% endhint %}

Once you have the testnet wallet downloaded, you can get testnet FRA tokens for gas and get testnet FRC20, FRC721, and FRC1155 tokens for performing the transfer loops.\


We have a walk through here if you get stuck üëá&#x20;

{% endcontent-ref %}

Once you have the wallet, you can sign up for the campaign on Project Galxe [here](https://galxe.com/Findora/campaign/GCi1YUKd12).

There are five tasks you‚Äôll need to complete to increase your rank. Here they are with their corresponding rank:

{% hint style="info" %}
Be sure to use the EVM wallet address (‚Äú0x‚Ä¶‚Äù) used to sign up for the campaign on Project Galxe to do your Prism++ transfers.
{% endhint %}

## Rules and Rewards

The campaign will run from March 24th to April 20th.&#x20;

There is **a grand prize pool of $10,000** for addresses that earn all 5 badges (called OATs on Project Galxe which stands for [On-chain Achievement Token](https://medium.com/galxe-news/introducing-galaxy-oat-on-chain-achievement-token-7e89779242b4)). 2,000 addresses that collect all 5 badges will share in the $10,000 grand prize pool, earning $5 each.

You can claim the badges as you progress through the tasks on Project Galxe, but it may take some time for your participation to be verified.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Please wait at least a couple of days after completing tasks before claiming your badge (OAT) from Project Galxe.
{% endhint %}

Make sure that the EVM address you use for Prism++ Transfers is the same as the one used to sign up for the campaign with Project Galxe.

Be sure to use the same UTXO addresses for confidential transactions for each task. We‚Äôll only be able to give you credit for your progress if you use the same UTXO addresses for each badge.
