# Prism++ Testing Campaign

üî•To celebrate the Prism++ launch on Anvil Testnet, we are launching a testing campaign with a total reward of $10,000 for the Findora community. We are launching this Testnet Campaign to invite the community to build with us.&#x20;

Those who complete the entire campaign, thus going from Prism Peasant to Pioneer, will receive:&#x20;

* 5 stunning NFT badges on Project Galaxe
* A share in the $10,000 prize pool
* Our eternal thanks and gratitude

It‚Äôs our small way of showing our gratitude for your effort in building ZK in Web3! Here are the details:&#x20;

## Campaign Overview&#x20;

To test Prism++, you‚Äôll embark on a journey from Prism Peasant to a Prism Pioneer. Your rank will increase with each task you complete.&#x20;

The process is simple and easy:&#x20;

1. [Sign up for the Campaign](peasant-prism++-campaign-signup.md) on Project Galaxe&#x20;
2. [Test Wallet Setup ](testnet-wallet-setup-funding.md)
3. Complete Prism++ Transfers
4. Level Up!

You‚Äôll keep leveling up as you complete more tasks and Prism++ Transfer Loops. To complete a Prism++ Transfer Loop, you‚Äôll transfer tokens from an EVM wallet to an UTXO Wallet using Prism++. Then you‚Äôll confidentially transfer those tokens between two UTXO wallets before transferring them back to the original EVM wallet using Prism++.\


Do this for FRC20, FRC721 and FRC1155 tokens to level up.

## Campaign Tasks and Ranks

To start, download the Findora testnet wallet and generate two wallet addresses. It‚Äôs easy to do, and we have a walkthrough here if you get stuck üëá&#x20;

{% endcontent-ref %}

Once you have the wallet, you can enter the campaign on Project Galaxe here. Once this is completed, you‚Äôll have already earned Peasant Badge!

{% endcontent-ref %}

There are five tasks you‚Äôll need to complete to increase your rank. Here they are with their corresponding rank:

| Badge                                                      | Level       | Task Needed to Earn it                            | Step to Step Guide                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ****![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/Level 1.png>)****     | **Peasant** | Sign up for the campaign on Project Galaxe        | [peasant-prism++-campaign-signup.md](peasant-prism++-campaign-signup.md "mention") |
| ****![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/Level 2.png>)****     | **Pupil**   | Complete Prism Transfer Loop with FRC20 tokens    | [frc20-token-transfers.md](frc20-token-transfers.md "mention")                     |
| ****![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/Level 3 (1).png>)**** | **Pilgrim** | Complete Prism Transfer Loop with FRC721 tokens   | [pilgrim-frc-721-token-transfers.md](pilgrim-frc-721-token-transfers.md "mention") |
| ****![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/Level 4.png>)****     | **Prodigy** | Complete Prism Transfer Loop with FRC1155 tokens  | [prodigy-frc1155-token-transfers.md](prodigy-frc1155-token-transfers.md "mention") |
| ****![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/Level 5.png>)****     | **Pioneer** | Complete Prism Transfer Loop on mainnet with USDT | [pioneer-mainnet-transfers.md](pioneer-mainnet-transfers.md "mention")             |

\
Once you become a Prism Peasant by entering the campaign, you‚Äôll also need to share the two UTXO addresses you‚Äôll use for confidential transfers as part of the Prism++ Transfer loop. Complete a Prism++ Transfer Loop for each token type on testnet. The final task is to complete a Prism++ Transfer Loop on mainnet using USDT.

You will need a small amount of FRA to pay gas and a small amount of USDT to transfer on mainnet. But don‚Äôt worry! We will airdrop every address with the Peasant badge the FRA and USDT they‚Äôll need to become a full-fledged Prism Pioneer.

NOTE: Be sure to use the EVM wallet address (‚Äú0x‚Ä¶‚Äù) that you used to sign up for the campaign on Project Galaxe to do your Prism++ transfers.&#x20;

Once you complete transfers for each token type, and do a final one on mainnet, you‚Äôll be a full-fledged Prism Pioneer, existing on the cutting edge of ZK technology!&#x20;

## Rules and Rewards

The campaign will run from March 24th to April, 20th.&#x20;

There is **a grand prize pool of $10,000** for addresses that earn all 5 badges (called OATs on Project Galaxe which stands for [On-chain Achievement Token](https://medium.com/galxe-news/introducing-galaxy-oat-on-chain-achievement-token-7e89779242b4)). 2,000 addresses that collect all 5 badges will share in the $10,000 grand prize pool, earning $5 each.

\
You can claim the badges as you go from Project Galaxe, but it may take some time for your participation to be verified. Please wait at least a couple of days after completing tasks before claiming your badge (OAT) from Project Galaxe.

Make sure that the EVM address you use for Prism++ Transfers is the same as the one used to sign up for the campaign with Project Galaxe. Also, be sure to use the same UTXO addresses for confidential transactions for each task. We‚Äôll only be able to give you credit for your progress if you use the same UTXO addresses for each badge.
