# Prism++ Testnet Campaign FAQs

**1. Where is the link to join the campaign?**

You can find the link here: [https://galxe.com/Findora/campaign/GCi1YUKd12](https://galxe.com/Findora/campaign/GCi1YUKd12)&#x20;

Additionally, you can learn more about the info and get relevant links in our [announcement article](https://galxe.com/Findora/campaign/GCi1YUKd12).



**2. Where is the sign-up form?**

Filling out this form lets us see your progress in the campaign so you can receive your OAT (on-chain achievement tokens) from Project Galxe and receive any airdrop funds you may have earned. Make sure the EVM wallet you list is the same one that you’ve connected to Project Galxe and the same one you’ll use for Prism++ transfers.&#x20;

**3. If I didn’t complete the sign-up form, can I get the rewards?**

No. Findora needs your wallet address to verify the on-chain tasks. If you didn’t complete the signup form with your wallet addresses, we can’t verify your completion of the tasks.\


**4. What Do I need to provide in the signup form?**

1. Your name
2. Your email address: we will contact you if you are eligible for any airdrop rewards.
3. EVM wallet address: you must provide the EVM wallet address which you use for all Prism++ tasks. It must be the same as the one you used to claim the OAT on Project Galxe.
4. Two UTXO wallet addresses. You’ll send FRC20, 721, and 1155 tokens between these addresses in the campaigns.&#x20;

It doesn’t matter what address you use first in the campaign or which one you list first in the form, as long as you use the same two addresses throughout the campaign.



**5. I have completed the on-chain tasks. Why can’t I claim the OAT?**

Due to the constraints on Galxe, we need to manually verify the on-chain tasks and update the rewards list on Galxe. We plan to do it daily, but if you can’t claim the OAT, its only because we haven’t updated the list yet. We’ll aim to update it within two business days.



**6. Where can I download the Testnet Wallet?**

Right here: [https://findora.org/testnet/](https://findora.org/testnet/)&#x20;



**7. Can I replace the Mainnet wallet application with the testnet wallet application?**

No. The testnet wallet application is only meant testnet campaigns at this time. Even if you switch to mainnet, it won’t reflect your token balances.&#x20;



**8. Where is the faucet for test tokens (FRC20/721/1155)?**

Right here: [https://faucet.findora.org/](https://faucet.findora.org/)



**9. I don’t have enough FRA gas fee for my UTXO wallets, how can I get some?**

You can get some FRA from the [faucet](https://faucet.findora.org/), then use the Prism++ to transfer the FRA from your EVM wallet to your UTXO native wallet. A more detailed guide can be found here: [https://docs.findora.org/general-user-materials/explore-testnet/prism++/prism++-testing-campaign/testnet-wallet-setup-funding#wallet-funding](https://docs.findora.org/general-user-materials/explore-testnet/prism++/prism++-testing-campaign/testnet-wallet-setup-funding#wallet-funding)&#x20;
