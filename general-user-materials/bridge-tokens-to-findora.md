# Bridging Tokens to Findora

#### Multichain Router&#x20;

Multichain is a seasoned protocol in the Web3 space and boasts a total value locked (TVL) of around [$1.5 Billion](https://defillama.com/protocol/multichain). It has connected a whopping 3,430 tokens across 83 chains, including Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Solana, and its 1:1 bridge enables zero-slippage transfers for innovative cross-chain functions.&#x20;

The partnership will allow liquidity to flow into the Findora ecosystem and let Findora export privacy all over Web3 through Multichain.

To learn how to use Multichain, check out their [video tutorial](../basics/introduction.md), or look at their [documentation](https://multichain.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4410379722639-Redeem-Remove-Pool-Token-Anyassets-e-g-anyUSDC-anyUSDT-anyDAI-anyETH-anyFTM-etc-into-Native-Token-Tutorial).

#### Rialto Bridge

[Rialto Bridge](https://rialtobridge.io/) is a modular multi-directional blockchain bridge to allow data and value transfer between a number of blockchains. This should enable users to specify a destination blockchain from their source chain and send data to that blockchain for consumption on the destination chain.

Built on Chainsafeâ€™s Chainbridge infrastructure, burnished and strengthened, it allows technologically different chains to communicate with each other, perform transactions against each other and settle balances at the end of a session.
