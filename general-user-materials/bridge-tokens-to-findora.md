[Rialto Bridge](https://rialtobridge.io/) is a modular multi-directional blockchain bridge to allow data and value transfer between a number of blockchains. This should enable users to specify a destination blockchain from their source chain and send data to that blockchain for consumption on the destination chain.

Built on Chainsafeâ€™s Chainbridge infrastructure, burnished and strengthened, it allows technologically different chains to communicate with each other, perform transactions against each other and settle balances at the end of a session.
