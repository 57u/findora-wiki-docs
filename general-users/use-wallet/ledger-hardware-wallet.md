# Ledger Hardware Wallet



Hardware Wallets (also known as cold storage) are physical devices that are not connected your computer or to the internet directly and hence allows you to store private keys securely while also allowing you to access funds or do transactions with convenience. The Findora Smart Chain allows you to use a ledger device for storing and transferring the assets on the chain. Follow this demo below to understand how to do this. The device used in this demo is Nanoledger X, but any hardware wallet should work fine with similar steps.

### Connect your ledger to Metamask[​](https://wiki.findora.org/docs/evm\_guides/use\_wallet/ledger-guide#connect-your-ledger-to-metamask) <a href="#connect-your-ledger-to-metamask" id="connect-your-ledger-to-metamask"></a>

Step 1: Select `Connect hardware wallet` in your Metamask settings dropdown

Step 3: Allow Metamask to connect to you hardware device

**NOTE**

Make sure that any other applications (such as Ledger Live) which might be connected to your hardware wallet are closed

Step 4: Once connected, unlock your account.

**NOTE**

The unit shows up as ETH because we are using the Ethereum app, but this will not affect the actual transfers with the ledger

Step 5: Verify your new Hardware wallet account on Findorascan

### Receive funds to your Ledger Address[​](https://wiki.findora.org/docs/evm\_guides/use\_wallet/ledger-guide#receive-funds-to-your-ledger-address) <a href="#receive-funds-to-your-ledger-address" id="receive-funds-to-your-ledger-address"></a>

Receiving funds to you ledger address would be the same process as any other transfer on the Findora EVM

* Setup the transfer and confirm

**NOTE**

Since we are using the Ethereum app, the amounts show up as ETH, but do not worry the actual transfer would be in FRA

Step 6: Approve the tx on the device by clicking both buttons together
