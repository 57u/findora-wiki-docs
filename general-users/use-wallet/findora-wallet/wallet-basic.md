Click the `Create Wallet` button and the app will display mnemonic "seed words" for you to write down and save for your own safe keeping — offline ideally.\
These mnemonic seed words are linked to a unique `private key` and wallet that the app will create and store for you inside the app.

> Note: Store these "seed words" securely as they will never be shown again and there is no way to recover them.

Click `Next` and enter in the seed words you saved earlier to verify you have securely saved the mnemonic seed words elsewhere.

The `My Wallet` screen lists all available wallet addresses managed by this app. Each wallet address is connected to a unique private key stored inside the app.\
Below the wallet name is the _wallet address_, which is a long string of random text and numbers. The _wallet address_ is the account where you will receive FRA tokens (or other custom tokens). Give your _wallet address_ to users who will be sending you tokens. You can get a copy of the wallet address via the two buttons below:

The button on the left copies the wallet address to memory so you can paste into an email or text message to give to the sender\
The button the right opens a QR code which you can scan with your mobile phone camera to import the address into your phone\
To view a wallet's `Balance`, click on the wallet address and you will be taken to `Wallet Info` page. The default token type displayed is `fra`.
