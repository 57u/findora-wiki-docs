* `From` - the wallet address you will send tokens from
* `To` - the wallet address you will send tokens to
* `Asset Type` - pull-down menu showing all available asset types (i.e. tokens) you can send\
  Note: If you have created (or imported in) custom asset types into your wallet, then you will be able to select these custom assets. Else, you will only see a single option for `fra` tokens
* `Amount` - amount to send to recipient
* `Show or Hide Amounts on Ledger?` - By selecting `Hide Amounts`, the transfer becomes a confidential transfer and the amount will be masked on the transaction log of the public block explorer
* `Show or Hide Asset Type on Ledger?` - By selecting `Hide Asset Type`, the transfer becomes a confidential transfer and the asset type will be masked on the transaction log of the public block explorer

2\. Click `Next` and a confirmation screen will appear
