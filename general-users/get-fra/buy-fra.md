# Buy FRA

One of the easiest ways to get FRA is on [Kucoin ](https://www.kucoin.com/)or [Gate.io](https://gate.io/), some of the top exchanges in the world. We’ll use **Kucoin** as an example here.

Once you’ve set up a Kucoin account, you still can’t buy FRA directly with fiat currency or a credit card - you will need to trade for FRA using USDT. So, step 1 is to buy some USDT on Kucoin or transfer some over to your Kucoin account.

Then, go to trading:

Once you do, you can search for FRA in the search bar in the right-hand side of the screen.

You’ll find the USDT/FRA trading pool. Click on that to trade USDT for FRA:

Once you click on Trade, you’ll be taken to the USDT/FRA trading pair where you can trade for FRA:

Buying FRA from Gate.io follows a similar process. So now, congratulations, you’ve got FRA!
