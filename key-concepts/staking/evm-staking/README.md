# EVM Staking

[EVM Staking](https://findora.org/2023/12/introducing-the-new-evm-staking-portal/) lets users stake EVM FRA instead of simply using UTXO FRA on the native chain. This change leads to two key benefits to the end user:

1. Delegators can stake FRA from Metamask using the [EVM Staking Portal](https://staking.findora.org/)
2. It opens the possibility of having CEXs operate a node on the Findora network

\
Staking from [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) greatly simplifies the staking process. Instead of needing to transfer tokens from the EVM Layer to the Native layer via Prism Transfer before staking using the [Findora wallet](https://findora.org/#wallet), users can stake with their preferred validator from an easy-to-use dashboard.
