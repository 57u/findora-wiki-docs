# EVM Staking Portal User Guide

[The new EVM Staking portal](https://staking.findora.org/) improves the user experience by making it much easier for delegators to manage their staking portfolio. It features a dashboard that shows the total amount of FRA owned, how much is staked and unstaked, and any unclaimed rewards. It also shows unbonding events and how much time is left before unbonded tokens are available.&#x20;

Users will also be able to see a breakdown of their current delegations based on the validators they are staking with. Finding validators on the portal will be much easier than when using the wallet. The portal breaks down validators into Top 100, Online, and Offline categories and provides a search function.

### How to Stake on the Portal

First, head to [staking.findora.org](https://staking.findora.org/) and connect your wallet. You can also access the portal from [findora.org/staking](https://findora.org/staking/) and clicking the “Stake Now” button. This takes you to your staking dashboard, which displays key information from your staking portfolio.&#x20;

From the portfolio, you can delegate unstaked FRA, claim rewards, and undelegate FRA.

If you have tokens that are unbonding, those will also be visible on the dashboard.

You’ll also be able to see at a glance which delegators you stake with:

To learn more about validators before staking, click “View all Validators” at the top of the dashboard. From there, you’ll be able to see the top 100 validators and sort by who is online and offline.

You can also delegate from this page by clicking the “Delegate” button next to a validator’s name.
