# Validator Toolbox Setup

Validator Toolbox is an all-in-one application that simplifies installing and managing a Findora node and validator wallet.

With a user-friendly interface, the toolbox allows users to quickly deploy and configure their own validator node, enabling them to securely participate in the Findora network and earn rewards for their contributions.&#x20;

If you don't already have a validator on Findora, follow the steps under "**New Build.**"&#x20;

For those with a validator on Findora, proceed to the "Existing Build" section.
