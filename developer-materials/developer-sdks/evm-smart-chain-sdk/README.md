# EVM Smart Chain SDK

Findora's EVM Smart Chain is 100% EVM compatible and, currently, there are no custom EVM tools built just for Findora. Instead, developers can simply re-use any existing Ethereum wallet or developer tool (Metamask, Hardhat, Remix, Truffle, etc.) or any existing Solidity code with Findora's EVM Smart Chain.

However, developers will need to configure their Ethereum wallets, Ethereum tools and codebase to point to Findora EVM Smart Chain network and the documentation in this section walks developers on how to configure these existing Ethereum wallets and developer tools to work on Findora.

Also, please see the [Network Settings](../../../network-settings/network-settings.md) section for a table listing all RPC, port and block explorer configuration details for all Findora networks (Mainent and Testnets).
