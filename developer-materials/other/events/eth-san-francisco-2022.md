## Findora Private Transactions

Findora‚Äôs Privacy Routing SDK will allow developers to mask certain attributes from on-chain transactions: sender/receiver address, asset type, and asset amount. Using the SDK, developers can send private transactions from one Findora EVM address to another Findora EVM address.

## Zero-Knowledge Decentralized ID (zkDID)

Findora‚Äôs `zkdid-js` SDK consists of a collection of APIs to create decentralized identifiers (DIDs), credentials and proofs to enable DID holders to prove credential data (i.e. private information) about themselves in a [zero-knowledge](https://hackernoon.com/eli5-zero-knowledge-proof-78a276db9eff) (zk) manner.

Zero-knowledge refers to the ability to cryptographically verify data without disclosing the exact credential value (i.e. cryptographically enable the verification that a DID holder‚Äôs credential contains credit score is above 700 ‚Äî without revealing the exact number to the verifier).

For a conceptual overview of DIDs, credentials and the stakeholders in the credentialing and verification processes, visit the [zkDID and Credentials](../../../key-concepts/zkdid-and-credentials.md) modules section of Findora‚Äôs documentation. Also, please see the official [W3C DID specification](https://www.notion.so/zkDID-Documentation-a-Modules-zkDID-Credentials-695f80687ec94d2fb32b3159f4ca945f).

## Support & Resources

Findora developers will be attending the onsite event in San Francisco to help support the hackathon participants. Additionally, developers may use the Findora Discord channel to ask questions and speak to a specialist from the team.
