## Findora Private Transactions

Findora‚Äôs Privacy Routing SDK will allow developers to mask certain attributes from on-chain transactions: sender/receiver address, asset type, and asset amount. Using the SDK, developers can send private transactions from one Findora EVM address to another Findora EVM address.

## Zero-Knowledge Decentralized ID (zkDID)

The initial MVP implementation of Findora‚Äôs zkDID currently excludes features expected in the final zkDID design such as i) non-transferable NFT support (to store the DIDs on-chain) and ii) IPFS integration to store credentials (and/or proofs) on-chain.
