# Acquire Testnet FRA

To test the Findora suite of applications or start building on the Findora network, you can request to receive testnet tokens via our web portal.

## Request FRA on Anvil Testnet

The Anvil network is Findora's testnet for developers needing a sandbox environment. Below are the steps to request Anvil testnet FRA tokens.

Step 1: Go to the [Testnet Faucet](https://faucet.findora.org)

Step 2: Scroll to the bottom and click the Verify Discord button. This will link your MetaMask address to your Discord account and help ensure that bots are filtered from the faucet.

Step 3: Return to the web faucet. Ensure the Anvil network is selected from the dropdown menu.

Step 4: Scroll down and select the type of token you need. Typically, this will be the Findora-EVM token type, which will be delivered to a 0x address specified in the wallet field.

Please allow for up to **15 minutes** before checking MetaMask for the testnet tokens, and ensure your MetaMask is set up for the Findora Anvil network. You should receive just over 100 testnet FRA once the transfer is completed.
