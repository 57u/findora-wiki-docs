## Pick a Track for Your EVM dApp on Findora:

**‚≠êÔ∏è Private Payroll**

Employee pay and salary are always sensitive ‚Äì and for good reason. If a team‚Äôs payment inequality is leaked to the public, it can lead to the disintegration of the team.&#x20;

Furthermore, contractors and vendors need to be able to keep their payments private so they don‚Äôt lose a competitive edge against a competitor who would otherwise try to game the system or undercut their work‚Äôs intended value.&#x20;

With Findora Triple Masking transfer, Zero Knowledge Proof-based payments on stablecoins hide all sensitive information (address, amount, and asset) from the public.\
\
**‚≠êÔ∏è Private NFT Ownership**

The implementation of privacy features on NFTs allows owners to better safeguard their ownership of a particular asset, as the address associated with these assets will not be publicly accessible. This reduces the risk of phishing attacks, eliminating a common attack vector that is prevalent online.&#x20;

Try to find a proper way to verify the ownership of an NFT without revealing the owner‚Äôs public key (and address).\
\
**‚≠êÔ∏è Private Card Games**

A card (or card-like) game using Findora mental-poker.

Enjoying a card game on the Ethereum blockchain presents a unique set of challenges compared to playing on a centralized game server. This is due to the transparency of data on the blockchain, where every card is publicly visible. To overcome this, card shuffling must be executed in a manner that prevents nodes/validators from gaining knowledge of any specific card in the deck.&#x20;

Additionally, players desire to keep their own cards concealed from one another until it is time to reveal them.

Note: Privacy Routing SDK can currently only be used on the Findora **Forge** Testnet. See [network settings](../../../network-settings/network-settings.md) for RPC details and request **Forge** EVM testnet `FRA` tokens [here](../../../general-user-materials/acquire-fra/request-fra-testnet.md).
{% endhint %}

## Findora Private Transactions

Findora‚Äôs Privacy Routing SDK will allow developers to mask specific attributes from on-chain transactions: sender/receiver address, asset type, and asset amount. Using the SDK, developers can send private transactions from one Findora EVM address to another Findora EVM address.

You can use privacy-routing-SDK to transfer any FRC-20 asset (including FRA) on Findora Smart Chain from Address A to Address B and remove the link between the two addresses. Both addresses can be classical user addresses or contract addresses.
