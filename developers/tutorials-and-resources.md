# Tutorials & Resources

dApp developers can take advantage of a wealth of resources and information already available to Ethereum developers. Findora's [smart chain](sdks/evm-smart-chain-sdk/) is 100% EVM-compatible, meaning developers are able to deploy their smart contracts and use existing toolings. Below are some resources to help you get started. Once ready, you can use [Ganache](sdks/evm-smart-chain-sdk/ethereum-developer-tools-and-wallets/configure-ganache.md) or similar tools to deploy on Findora by visiting the [networks settings](../network-settings/network-settings.md) page.
