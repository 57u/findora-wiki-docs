# Game-Specific Chains

Game-Specific Chains (or GSCs) are gaming-optimized subnets on Findora with customizable block times and Findora's brand-new zkGaming SDK built-in. The first GSC instance, Findora GSC, will feature 2-second block times, and GSCs have been tested to as much as 3,000 TPS. They are fast, secure, EVM compatible, and use powerful zero-knowledge cryptography for unique on-chain game mechanics with randomization and provable fairness.
